These are a couple of plugins that I wrote for my Tekkit server to
help with a few issues that came up.  Prebuilt jars that should work with
3.0.4 and 3.1.1 servers are in the 'output' folder, and you just
need to put them in the server's 'plugin' directory.

NFItemWatch monitors for loose item entities lying around on
the ground and warns you if there are too many accumulating and
where they're located.  By default it will check every 5
minutes and print a report of where the five largest concentrations
of items are if there are more than 1024 in the world, but you
can force an immediate check with the '/nfitem' command.

NFChunk will tell you the coordinates of any chunk loader blocks
in the current chunk if you run the "/chunk check" command, in case
you forgot which wall you buried them in.  This needs to be updated,
as it currently only looks for teleport tethers.

TODO: Make more stuff configurable.
